  <root><h1>Zach's Rules for Nice Programs</h1>

<ul><li><p>programs should run locally on your computer as applications, not in a browser:
<p> - because software should last longer than the company serving it</p>
<p> - because it should feel offline-first: caching an app in a browser doesn't communicate this feature nearly as clearly as the app living on your desktop</p>
<p> - because users should be able to see how an app is using their computer's resources, instead of having that obscured behind the monolithic browser</p></p></li>

<li><p>programs should store files in human-readable format [except bin data I guess] in an accessible folder on your computer:
<p> - e.g. to-do apps should reference a folder on your desktop filled with plain text files of to-dos</p>
<p> - because users should be able to see clearly what an app is doing behind the scenes (computers should be open and understood, not closed and mystical)</p>
<p> - because users should be able to easily transfer their data between themselves and others, between devices, and between apps; </p>
<p> ---&gt; <i>the back-end of a program should be as visible and understandable as its front-end</i></p></p></li>

<li><p>programs should strive to be infinitely hackable, customizable, extensible
<p> - people should be the architects of their digital livesâ€“ computer programs should enable this, not prevent it</p>
<p> - see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Alexander">Christopher Alexander</a>: <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Timeless_Way_of_Building">The Timeless Way of Building</a></i> and <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Pattern_Language">A Pattern Language</a></i>. He argues that a "living" architecture would be continuously designed and constructed by its inhabitants; "living" software should as well.</p></p></li></ul></root>
