Things I want:
- a site for comparing programming languages or other bits of tech stacks with actual hand-written copy about the differences between two / why to use one or another

- a site that aggregates tutorials for shit I want to learn how to do - and lets me pay people a little bit if I appreciate their tutorial

- a public log of my work, maybe organized by start of day and like the event log for each day is expandable behind the start of day

- a cute way to chat my friends (public and private channels)

- cute music production tools that just spit out notes rather than asking me to arrange them in a grid or locking me into boring rhythms

- a collaborative website builder for non-coders and coders alike

- a foss drag and drop website builder

- a way to see what everyone is working on that's not Twitter and maybe public events on here too

- a robust solderless diy hardware setup (like littlebits for any electronics)

- a site for pairing freelance devs/designers with clients that's built around the client pitching their project rather than the dev pitching their skills

- always on video channel just for hanging when remote working

- a cheaper, lower power VPS than the lowest DO option

- simple diy screen printing

- a tiny projector that sits on the corner of my laptop and projects a second screen down and to the side onto the surface my laptop is resting on

- blockchain designed from a cooperative/social ideology (instead of game theory)

- p2p version of Meetup for small workshops

- portable mesh network with cute little modems
