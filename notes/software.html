        <h3>
          programs should run locally on your computer as applications, not in a
          browser:
        </h3>
        <li>
          - because software should last longer than the company serving it
        </li>
        <li>
          - because it should feel offline-first: caching an app in a browser
          doesn't communicate this feature nearly as clearly as the app living
          on your desktop
        </li>
        <li>
          - because users should be able to see how an app is using their
          computer's resources, instead of having that obscured behind the
          monolithic browser
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="indexx">
        <h3>
          programs should store files in human-readable format [except bin data
          I guess] in an accessible folder on your computer:
        </h3>
        <li>
          - e.g. to-do apps should reference a folder on your desktop filled
          with plain text files of to-dos
        </li>
        <li>
          - because users should be able to see clearly what an app is doing
          behind the scenes (computers should be open and understood, not closed
          and mystical)
        </li>
        <li>
          - because users should be able to easily transfer their data between
          themselves and others, between devices, and between apps;
        </li>
        <li>
          ---&gt;
          <i
            >the back-end of a program should be as visible and understandable
            as its front-end</i

        <h3>
          programs should strive to be infinitely hackable, customizable,
          extensible
        </h3>
        <li>
          - people should be the architects of their digital lives and computer
          programs should enable this, not prevent it

          designed and constructed by its inhabitants; "living" software should
