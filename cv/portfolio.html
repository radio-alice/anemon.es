            I was recently invited to perform at an audiovisual festival on
            campus, along with friends who make claymations and techno music.
            For the show, I developed a NodeJS web app that used websockets to
            allow people to control 'dancing' characters in the visuals. For
            the visuals themselves, I created a Unity app that served as the
            glue between a variety of visual effects:
          </p>
          <p>1) the dancing characters (controlled by viewers' phones via websocket)</p>
          <p>2) live-edited GLSL shaders that morphed in response to incoming audio</p>
          <p>3) midi-triggered claymation loops and</p>
          <p>4) live midi-controlled Unity camera effects.</p>
          <p>
            Over the course of this project I learned how to use websockets
            to pass data between apps and demonstrated the ability to organize
            people with divergent talents (animation, music production, and
            programming) into a cohesive team that was able to produce a
            "brain-melting" performance.

            Over the course of this intense project, I learned how to
            design data structures with specific operations in mind and how
            to think in the functional programming paradigm. It wasn't easy:
            my code was pretty
            <a href="https://github.com/radio-alice/racket-hw/blob/master/graded-work/graded-project2">
            broken</a> at the penultimate checkpoint, but I stuck with it,
            worked out all the issues and got
            <a href="https://github.com/radio-alice/racket-hw/blob/master/graded-work/graded-project3">
            full points</a> on the final project.

            I thought it would be funny if people could text my mom
            right from my website, so I made an little web app for it.
            To build this, I taught myself Node, Express, MongoDB and
            some light form verification to make sure people could only
            send her emojis.

            [ Note: now just a static page- the gmail api I was using got removed, so you can't text her anymore :( ]

            Followed an "intro to webassembly + Rust" book that showed how to
            implement Conway's game of life in a web page. Though the idea came
            from the book, I modified the original code heavily. This project
            made me really appreciate Rust's type checker and memory safety, especially when compared to a language like C.
