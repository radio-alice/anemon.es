              Streams is an experimental product that creates shareable feeds of
              your work; the prototype linked above organizes GitHub events for
              any given repo. I led a series of iterative design sprints–
              sketching, prototyping, and user-testing a variety of
              organizational schemes for your GitHub events.
            </p>
            <p>
              For these experiments, I was entirely responsible for the visual
              design and its implementation. I also contributed significantly to
              prior user research, application logic (react + redux), and
              user-testing.

              The goal of this sprint was to design a product for sharing your
              work with collaborators while substituting the work of app
              integrations (like GitHub) with manual updates by users
              themselves. For this sprint I decided to validate the hypothesis
              with the Figma prototype itself. I created the initial (paper)
              skeches and 80% of the prototyping for this sprint and was
              completely responsible for user-testing.

          At UChicago I studied design, ecology, sociology, computer science,
          etc., learning to think systemically about a wide variety of problems.
          Political organizing taught me how to lead effective teams and
          collaborate with people who had totally different backgrounds from my
          own (and win a bunch of people-powered victories!). In UChicago's
          design program I practices using my systems-analysis skills to
          actually create useful products. Most importantly, I learned to
          quickly teach myself anything, whether it's a programming language or
          a design approach, and to collaborate and communicate effectively.
        </p>
        <!-- <p>
          I believe that good design emerges from understanding larger systems
          and how your product interacts with them– my various college
          experiences prepared me to build products for a world that extends far
          beyond Silicon Valley.

              I was invited to perform at an audiovisual festival on campus,
              along with friends who make claymations and techno music. For the
              show, I developed a NodeJS web app that used websockets to allow
              people to control 'dancing' characters in the visuals. For the
              visuals themselves, I created a Unity app that served as the glue
              between a variety of visual effects: 1) the dancing characters
              (controlled by viewers' phones via websocket) 2) live-edited GLSL
              shaders that morphed in response to incoming audio 3)
              midi-triggered claymation loops and 4) live midi-controlled Unity
              camera effects.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the course of this project I learned how to use websockets to
              pass data between apps and organized people with divergent talents
              (animation, music production, and programming) into a cohesive
              team that produced a brain-melting performance.

              Over the course of this intense project, I learned how to design
              data structures with specific operations in mind and how to think
              in the functional programming paradigm. It wasn't easy: my code
              was pretty

                broken</a

              at the penultimate checkpoint, but I stuck with it, worked out all
              the issues and got

              on the final project, which is pretty cool if you care about that
              sort of thing.

              I thought it would be funny if people could text my mom right from
              my website, so I made an little web app for it. To build this, I
              taught myself Node, Express, MongoDB and some light form
              verification to make sure people could only send her emojis. [
              Note: now just a static page- the gmail api I was using got
              removed, so you can't text her anymore :( ]

            Followed an "intro to webassembly + Rust" book that showed how to
            implement Conway's game of life in a web page. Though the idea came
            from the book, I modified the original code heavily. This project
            made me really appreciate Rust's borrow checker and pattern
            matching, especially when compared to a language like C.

              Built it all myself; the css isn't clean and reusable but I want
              to style every page differently anyway. No build step means I can
              deploy it in one command–
              <code>$ dat .</code>
              sends all the files to a dat + http server I have running. Also it
              has some fun audio effects you should check out (on Chrome please!
              Firefox audio api is all crackly).
