        <p class="no-top">
          At OWL, my ability to quickly pick up new skills and eye for design
          significantly increased team velocity. I designed systems that
          encouraged user modification and customization, created prototypes and
          established a visual identity for an early-stage company that was
          still searching for product-market-fit. Working with experienced
          product developers, I conducted five design sprints over a period of
          five weeks, using user-testing results to iterate on product
          prototypes. Under the tutelage of senior JavaScript engineers my code
          became far more maintainable and declarative. I also gained extensive
          experience working with experimental decentralized-web technologies.

              Streams is an experimental product that creates shareable feeds of
              your work; the prototype linked above organizes GitHub events for
              any given repo. We iterated on GitHub protoypes over the course of
              four design sprints, the last two of which were led by me–
              sketching, prototyping, and user-testing a variety of
              organizational schemes for your GitHub events. First we decided to
              simply present a firehose of events, with composable filters being
              the only way to organize. Based on user-tests, the next iterations
              experimented with variety of schemas for grouping events. We found
              that for the most part, people wanted to use this tool to keep
              track of others' work, not their own. So in the iteration linked
              above, we chose to group events by branch and pull request–
              balancing concise high-level overviews of others' work, with the
              ability to quickly view any details that interest you. If I were
              to run another design sprint for this prototype, I would add the
              ability to visualize events across multiple repos and move the
              filters and title to the side or to a drawer, so that the groups
              of events become the center of the interface. Our hypothesis was
              that people would use this to view events (and groups of events),
              so events should be given visual precedence over the filters and
              title.

            For these experiments, I was entirely responsible for the visual

            redux).

              This next <em>Streams</em> design sprint was led entirely by me.
              The goal of this sprint was to design a product for sharing your
              work with collaborators while substituting the work of app
              integrations (like GitHub) with manual updates by users
              themselves. I wanted to find out if all the hassle with different
              applications' event APIs was worth it or if people would use a
              separate product that asked them to manually keep track of changes
              to resources (represented by links). For this sprint I decided to
              test the figma prototype itself, rather than taking the time to
              build a working version before we knew if people even wanted it. I
              conducted four user tests and concluded that the current iteration
              did not offer enough of an improvement over in-app communication
              to convince people to use it, so we decided not to build it and
              saved ourselves significant development time.

          At UChicago, my studies encompassed a wide range of fields from
          ecology to political theory and exposed me to the diverse perspectives
          I bring to bear on my work today. I developed a deep commitment to
          building cooperative alternatives to capitalism and small, human
          peer-to-peer software + computers. Pursuing this, I taught myself web
          and video-game development and devoted much of my time to community
          organizing. Most of the
          <a href="http://shrmntoys.anemon.es/toys" target="_blank">projects</a>
          I developed were completely self-directed and focused on getting a
          proof-of-concept working rather than crafting maintainable, scalable
          code. The most important skill I picked up was the ability to quickly
          teach myself anything, whether it's a programming language or a design
          approach.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe that good design emerges from understanding larger systems
          and how your product interacts with them– my various college
          experiences prepared me to build products for a world that extends far
          beyond Silicon Valley.

          <p>
            I was invited to perform at an audiovisual festival on campus, along
            with friends who make claymations and techno music. For the show, I
            developed a NodeJS web app that used websockets to allow people to
            control 'dancing' characters in the visuals. For the visuals
            themselves, I created a Unity app that served as the glue between a
            variety of visual effects:
          </p>
          <p>
            1) the dancing characters (controlled by viewers' phones via
            websocket)
          </p>
          <p>
            2) live-edited GLSL shaders that morphed in response to incoming
            audio
          </p>
          <p>3) midi-triggered claymation loops and</p>
          <p>4) live midi-controlled Unity camera effects.</p>
          <p>
            Over the course of this project I learned how to use websockets to
            pass data between apps and organized people with divergent talents
            (animation, music production, and programming) into a cohesive team
            that produced a brain-melting performance.

            Over the course of this intense project, I learned how to design
            data structures with specific operations in mind and how to think in
            the functional programming paradigm. It wasn't easy: my code was

            I thought it would be funny if people could text my mom right from
            my website, so I made an little web app for it. To build this, I
            taught myself Node, Express, MongoDB and some light form
            verification to make sure people could only send her emojis. [ Note:
            now just a static page- the gmail api I was using got removed, so
            you can't text her anymore :( ]

            Followed an "intro to webassembly + Rust" book that showed how to
            implement Conway's game of life in a web page. Though the idea came
            from the book, I modified the original code heavily. This project
            made me really appreciate Rust's borrow checker and pattern
            matching, especially when compared to a language like C.

            Built it all myself; the css isn't clean and reusable but I want to
            style every page differently anyway. No build step means I can
            deploy it in one command–
            <code>$ dat .</code>
            sends all the files to a dat + http server I have running. Also it
            has some fun audio effects you should check out (on Chrome please!
            Firefox audio api is all crackly).
