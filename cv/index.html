            <p>
              Our team found that it's all to easy for people on teams to lose
              track of what work their team is doing. Also it's pretty difficult
              to ambiently capture and share that work. Our goal was to turn
              organizing and sharing work into a continuous, passive process. In
              its early iterations, Streams was an experimental product that
              created shareable feeds of your GitHub events for any given repo.
            </p>
            <p>
              I led a series of iterative design sprints– sketching,
              prototyping, and user-testing a variety of organizational schemes
              for your GitHub events. Along the way, we learned that filtering
              and grouping the firehose of data is crucial to its usefulness
              (people do a lot on GitHub). I also tried out a bunch of different
              UI tricks to filter out information, while making that data easily
              accessible through user interactions.
            </p>
            <p>
              For these experiments, I was entirely responsible for the visual
              design and its implementation. I also contributed significantly to
              prior user research, application logic (React + Redux), and
              user-testing. If I had to do it again, I would test Figma
              prototypes first instead of fully built web apps.

            <p>
              The goal of this sprint was much the same as the previous: design
              a product for sharing your work with collaborators. This time, I
              tried substituting the work of api integrations (e.g. GitHub) with
              manual updates by users themselves. If this was something people
              desperately needed, would they be willing to manually report when
              they had edited docs or pushed code?
            </p>
            <p>
              For this sprint I decided to validate the hypothesis with the
              Figma prototype itself. I created the initial (paper) skeches and
              80% of the prototyping for this sprint and was completely
              responsible for user-testing.
            </p>
            <p>
              We found that, no, people do not need something like this badly
              enough to go through the effort of manual updates, unless their
              work is spread between like eight to ten apps with no integrations
              between any of them.

              client so that my friends and I can have a cute, self-hosted
              social network to post about politics and art. Right now our
              biggest problem is the inherent ephemerality of our groupchat— it
              doesn't really succeed as a collaborative thinking space, because
              it has no long-term memory. When messages are constantly buried
              under new ones, it places the burden on us to remember previous
              conversations. So the ultimate design goal for e-worm is to create
              a self-archiving conversational interface that preserves thought
              and helps us keep thinking new things rather than going in
              intellectual circles.
            </p>
            <p>
              One idea I'm testing is emphasizing threads in the UI to force us
              to delineate our conversations rather than having an unparseable
              monolithic stream of consciousness (as in our current groupchat).
              I plan to add an export to
              <a href="http://are.na" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                >are.na</a
              >
              button on each thread that will create a channel from the thread
              with each message as a 'block'. Higher level channels will
              categorize these 'thread' channels by subject. I chose are.na
              because its interface encourages a sort of public digital memory
              that I haven't found with any other software. However, are.na
              itself doesn't have the conversational UI that I think is
              necessary for a real-time collaborative thinking tool— it's
              interface is more about discovering and connecting than
              communicating directly.

          At UChicago I studied design, ecology, sociology, computer science,
          etc., learning to think systemically about a wide variety of problems.
          Political organizing taught me how to lead effective teams and
          collaborate with people who had totally different backgrounds from my
          own (and win a bunch of people-powered victories!). In UChicago's
          design program I practiced using my systems-analysis skills to create
          useful products. Most importantly, I learned to quickly teach myself
          anything, whether it's a programming language or a design approach,
          and to collaborate and communicate effectively.
        </p>
        <!-- <p>
          I believe that good design emerges from understanding larger systems
          and how your product interacts with them– my various college
          experiences prepared me to build products for a world that extends far
          beyond Silicon Valley.

              I was invited to perform at an audiovisual festival on campus,
              along with friends who make claymations and techno music. For the
              show, I developed a NodeJS web app that used websockets to allow
              people to control 'dancing' characters in the visuals. For the
              visuals themselves, I created a Unity app that served as the glue
              between a variety of visual effects: 1) the dancing characters
              (controlled by viewers' phones via websocket) 2) live-edited GLSL
              shaders that morphed in response to incoming audio 3)
              midi-triggered claymation loops and 4) live midi-controlled Unity
              camera effects.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the course of this project I learned how to use websockets to
              pass data between apps and organized people with divergent talents
              (animation, music production, and programming) into a cohesive
              team that produced a brain-melting performance.
