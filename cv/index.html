            <p>
              Through a series of interviews with companies building open-source
              software, we found that they have a lot of difficulty tracking and
              organizing their work. Also there lack a simple way to ambiently
              capture and share that work. Our goal was to turn organizing and
              sharing work into a continuous, passive process. We wanted to
              replace the "hey just updated this doc" or "just PRed that branch"
              slack messages with a tool that updates teammates automatically
              and enables more asynchronous work. In its early iterations,
              Streams was an experimental product that created shareable feeds
              of your GitHub events for any given repository.
            </p>
            <p>
              I led a series of iterative design sprints– sketching,
              wireframing, prototyping, and user-testing a variety of
              organizational schemes for a team’s GitHub events. Along the way,
              we learned that filtering and grouping the firehose of data is
              crucial to its usefulness (people do a lot on GitHub). I also
              tried out a bunch of different UI tricks to filter out
              information, while making that data easily accessible through user
              interactions.
            </p>
            <p>
              For these experiments, I was entirely responsible for the visual
              design and its implementation. I also contributed significantly to
              prior user research, application logic (React + Redux), and
              user-testing. If I had to do it again, I would test Figma
              prototypes first instead of fully built web apps.

            <p>
              The goal of this sprint was much the same as the previous: design
              a product for sharing your work with collaborators. This time, I
              tried substituting the work of api integrations (e.g. GitHub) with
              manual updates by users themselves. If people desperately needed a
              way to view all their team’s work in one place, would they be
              willing to manually report when they had edited docs or pushed
              code?
            </p>
            <p>
              For this sprint I decided to validate the hypothesis with the
              Figma prototype itself. I created the initial (paper) sketches,
              wireframes and 80% of the figma mockup and was completely
              responsible for user-testing. I tried to use the onboarding flow
              to ease users into the understanding the full UI, by presenting a
              vastly simplified step-by-step walkthrough of sharing updates with
              a teammate. I then expose the entire UI with the corresponding
              parts of the ‘compose’ window filled in, so that users can easily
              see map the questions they answered in onboarding onto the
              full-fledged UI.
            </p>
            <p>
              I found that, no, people do not need something like this badly
              enough to go through the effort of manual updates– unless their
              work is spread between like eight to ten apps with no integrations
              between any of them. Document-specific updates take place within
              their respective apps (i.e. GitHub or Google docs) and via Slack
              or a project-management tool. A single place to view all of your
              team’s work was not valuable enough to convince people to
              construct that place manually with yet another app.

              client so that my friends and I can have a cute, self-hosted
              social network to post about politics and art. Besides being much
              more visually interesting than our facebook messenger groupchat,
              e-worm also attempts to solve design problems around
              conversational, collaborative thinking. The biggest of these
              problems is the inherent ephemerality of our groupchat— it doesn’t
              really succeed as a collaborative thinking space because it has no
              long-term memory. When messages are constantly buried under new
              ones, it places the burden on us to remember previous
              conversations. So the ultimate design goal for e-worm is to create
              a self-archiving conversational interface that preserves thought
              and helps us keep thinking new things rather than going in
              intellectual circles.
            </p>
            <p>
              One idea I’m testing is emphasizing threads in the UI to force us
              to delineate our conversations rather than having an unparseable
              monolithic stream of consciousness (as in our current groupchat).
              These threads currently have top-level tags that are chosen from a
              few preset options when the first post is added. No one has really
              been making use of these, so I’m in the process of testing out
              other options.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also plan to add an ‘export to
              <a href="http://are.na" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                >are.na</a
              >’ button on each thread that will create a channel from the
              thread with each message as a ‘block’. Higher level channels will
              categorize these ‘thread’ channels by subject. I chose are.na
              because its interface encourages a sort of public digital memory
              that I haven’t found with any other software. Are.na itself
              doesn’t have the <em>conversational</em> UI that I think is
              necessary for a real-time collaborative thinking tool— it’s
              interface is more about discovering and connecting than
              communicating directly. I’m still sketching out ideas for how to
              better tie these two interfaces (e-worm conversation and are.na
              archive) into one.
            </p>
            <p>
              The UI is completely navigable by keyboard shortcuts, which can be
              viewed by holding down the ‘control’ key.

              This wasn’t a particularly in-depth UX exercise, but it highlights
              how I use aesthetics to encourage certain modes of interaction.
              The original etherpad interface was plain and conservative, but we
              (the collaborators) are whacked out and radical. Aesthetics set
              the tone of interaction and I believe that they should mirror the
              goals of the interface, not fight it. The goals of this interface
              were (similar to e-worm.club) to create a space for radical,
              non-linear, collaborative thinking that would preserve those
              thoughts rather than cast them aside. These sorts of interactions
              would have been oddly dissonant with the original etherpad
              interface but were harmonious with (and even encouraged by) my
              version.
            </p>
            <p>
              If "beautiful interfaces" were an objective standard than we
              wouldn’t have UI design trends— I choose aesthetics based on the
              feelings and interactions I want to encourage, not some handwavey
              notion of beauty or what’s popular on dribble.

              to style every page differently anyway. No build step means I can
              deploy it in one command–

              sends all the files to a dat + http server I have running. Also it
              has some fun audio effects you should check out (on Chrome please!

          At UChicago I studied design, ecology, sociology, computer science,
          etc., learning to think systemically about a wide variety of problems.
          After studying so many different disciplines, both within and outside
          the classroom, I learned how to quickly teach myself anything from
          programming languages to research methodologies.</p

          Political organizing taught me how to lead effective teams and
          collaborate with people who had totally different backgrounds from my
          own. We also won a ton of people-powered victories across Chicago and
          Illinois.

              I was invited to perform at an audiovisual festival on campus,
              along with friends who make claymations and techno music. For the
              show, I developed a NodeJS web app that used websockets to allow
              people to control 'dancing' characters in the visuals. For the
              visuals themselves, I created a Unity app that served as the glue
              between a variety of visual effects: 1) the dancing characters
              (controlled by viewers' phones via websocket) 2) live-edited GLSL
              shaders that morphed in response to incoming audio 3)
              midi-triggered claymation loops and 4) live midi-controlled Unity
              camera effects.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the course of this project I learned how to use websockets to
              pass data between apps and organized people with divergent talents
              (animation, music production, and programming) into a cohesive
              team that produced a brain-melting performance.
